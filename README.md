# 🎬 movie-theater

## 🎯 Getting Started
movie recommendation application to get the next show/movie to watch using [MDB api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3), this application was made using reactJs and sass, I have to build a node js server to work as a proxy for API KEY protection



## 👨‍💻 How to use
1. clone the repo and create a .env file with your environment variables
2. Get your `API_KEY` from [MDB api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) and adding it as an env variable
3. run `npm install` to install the packages for the server and the frontend application
4. run `npm run server` to start the development backend server and `npm run client` for the react development server
